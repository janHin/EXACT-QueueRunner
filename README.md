# EXACT QueueRunner 
### Decentralized worker prototype to run algorithms for EXACT.

<img width="912" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10051592/222464596-ca1574a2-f66b-413f-bf3e-094542f424b3.png">

EXACT QueueRunner is a process that will query the processing queue on an EXACT server for processing jobs that it can perform. Each QueueRunner
might server different plugins. 

## Installation
You can install this package by downloading the repo and running `pip install .`
from the root folder. For development an editable installation is useful `pip
install -e .`.

## Usage
After installing the package you can call it directly from the command line via
the provided entry point `queue_runner ` or call the package `python -m
exact_queue_runner`. 
To start a worker use `queue_runner run`. To learn more about available commands
and option run `queue_runner --help`, e.g.:
```
queue_runner run --help
Usage: queue_runner run [OPTIONS]

  Start an Exact Queue Runner worker

Options:
  --joblimit INTEGER   maximum number of jobs
  --restart            restart upon error
  --idlelimit FLOAT    idle time limit in seconds
  --outdir PATH
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

## Add a new PlugIn

For a new plugin, the following files need to be added:
- plugin script (e.g. see [plugin-midog2022.py](src_exact_queue_runner/plugin-midog2022.py))
> [!TIP]
> Create a separate folder for each PlugIn to save extra inference files/packages.

Integration between the plugins and the QueueRunner is done through a registry
mechanismthat in terms of a class wraper that provides a dictionary for registering the plugin on the
exact servers:
```
@registerplugin({
    'name':'MIDOG 2022 Mitosis Domain Adversarial Baseline',
    'author':'Frauke Wilm / Marc Aubreville', 
    'package':'science.imig.midog2022.baseline-da', 
    'contact':'marc.aubreville@thi.de', 
    'abouturl':'https://github.com/DeepPathology/EXACT-QueueRunner/', 
    'icon':'handlers/MIDOG2022/midog_2022_logo.png',
    'products':[],
    'results':[],
})
class PluginMIDO2022(PluginBase):

    def do_inference(self, job: PluginJob):
        #This is where your actual implementation goes
```


## Available PlugIns

Currently, the following PlugIns are available. 

- The MIDOG 2021 baseline multi-domain mitotic figure detector by Frauke Wilm trained with domain adversarial training. For more about the approach, please have a look at the following paper:
